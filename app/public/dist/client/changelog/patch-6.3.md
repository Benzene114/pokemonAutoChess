# Changes to Synergies

# Changes to Items

# Gameplay

# UI

- Simplified the collection system UI. Added counters for portraits unlocked, shinies unlocked, and pokémons played.

# Collection system rework

- Booster now immediately unlocks the emote you get from the card. Some emotions are rarer than others. If you draw an emote you already unlocked, you get 50 shards instead (250 if shiny).
- Shiny rate in boosters is increased: 3% → 5%
- Your collection now displays the number of times you've played each Pokémon. This count is not retroactive, every player starts with an empty pokédex as of this patch.


# Bugfix

# Misc

- Changed title Duke: owns at least one emote of all current pokémons in the game ; all the accounts hat this title before this patch lose it.
- New title: Collector: has played all current pokémons in the game
- Putting the evolved pokemon into the team planner should mark the basic pokemon in the shop
